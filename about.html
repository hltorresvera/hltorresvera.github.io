## about me

Puertorican born in Texas but raised Ponce.

I did my B.S. in chemistry at the University of Puerto Rico at Cayey, where I got heavily involved in scientific research. This led me to pursue a Ph.D. in the Department of Molecular and Cell Biology at the University of California, Berkeley.

Currently, I am Managing Editor for the Berkeley Science Review and a Senior Editor for SciCommBites, as well as an author and editor for the MCB Transcript at UC Berkeley.

My motivation in life is to bring the joy and excitement of scientific discovery to others by sharing my genuine fascination with the world and how it works.
