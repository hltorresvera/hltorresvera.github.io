I was raised by my mom in Ponce, Puerto Rico.

From there, I did my B.S. in chemistry at the University of Puerto Rico at Cayey, where I got heavily involved in scientific research. This led me to pursue a Ph.D. in the Department of Molecular and Cell Biology at the University of California, Berkeley.

Currently, I am Managing Editor for the Berkeley Science Review and a Senior Editor for SciCommBites, as well as an author and editor for the MCB Transcript at UC Berkeley.

My motivation in life is to bring the joy and excitement of scientific discovery to others by sharing my genuine fascination with the world and how it works.

Iâ€™ve always loved computers. One of my favorite things to do on them was to record voice memos of myself acting like a news anchor and then slow them down or make them faster to distort my voice the sound of my voice. I was also a fan of Space Cadet Full Tilt! Pinball, Neopets, and this one obscure snowboarding game called SkiFree (that Yeti jump scare haunts me to this day). Even now, I still am quite a video game enthusiast. You can check out some of my favorites in my archive.

I adopted Fjord in 2022 from Cat Town rescue and cat-cafe in Oakland, CA. Since then, he has been nothing but a joy in my life. He is a fully indoor cat, and is missing all his teeth due to severe gum-disease. That hasn't stopped him from being the most loving cat one could ask for. From shop cat to lap cat, one Churu at a time.
