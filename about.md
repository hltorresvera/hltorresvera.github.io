## about me

<div class="about-container">
  <div class="text">
    <p>Puertorican born in Texas but raised in Ponce.</p>
    <p>I did my B.S. in chemistry at the University of Puerto Rico at Cayey, where I got heavily involved in scientific research. This led me to pursue a Ph.D. in the Department of Molecular and Cell Biology at the University of California, Berkeley.</p>
    <p>Currently, I am Managing Editor for the Berkeley Science Review and SciCommBites, as well as an author and editor for the MCB Transcript at UC Berkeley.</p>
    <p>My motivation in life is to bring the joy and excitement of scientific discovery to others by sharing my genuine fascination with the world and how it works.</p>
