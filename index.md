Iâ€™m a queer, Boricua, molecular biologist and science writer.

In my thesis work, I'm using cryo-electron microscopy and electrophysiology to understand the structure and function of channelrhodopsins.

I'm also a strategic, evidence-based, science communicator. My practices aim to foster trust, build community, and increase citizen engagement with research.
