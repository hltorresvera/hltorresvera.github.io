Iâ€™m a queer, Boricua, molecular biologist and science writer.  
In my thesis work, I'm using electrophysiology and cryo-electron microscopy to decipher the structure and function of blue-shifed channelrhodopsins for optogenetics applications.

I also use strategic, evidence-based communication practices to foster trust, build community, and increase citizen engagement with the scientific community.
